# Fable.Flutter

Fable bindings for Flutter API

For testing, you can open the `src/sample_app` directory in a Flutter compatible IDE. Then run `./build.sh` (or just copy & paste the commands in the script to a terminal) to start Fable in watch mode. Use the IDE to start debugging the Flutter app, you'll have to trigger hot reload manually after changes in F# code (e.g. in VS Code with Flutter extension press Ctr+F5).
